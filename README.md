# Softsys-Jetracer
This was the final project for  Software for Sensors & Systems(MECH 5970) at Auburn University. The project was organized as a Grand Prix, loosely inspired by the Pixar movie Cars, where students would race RC cars equipped with a Jetson Nano, a camera, and a Marvelmind Indoor Positioning Beacon.  The goal was to apply C++ and ROS2 knowledge learned throughout the semester to have the car autonomously race against, and beat the other students.

This repository has been organized with each branch being a different ROS2 package. This project does require other ROS2 packages to work that are not included in this repository as they were not created by our group.  The packages we did create can be found below:
- [Cam Control](https://github.com/walterlivingston/Softsys-Jetracer/tree/cam_control)
- [Sally Messages](https://github.com/walterlivingston/Softsys-Jetracer/tree/sally_msgs)
- [RViz Support](https://github.com/walterlivingston/Softsys-Jetracer/tree/rviz_support)

This was a group project, and our group can be seen below.  The group was named Sally after the movie character from Cars, and starting on the left, our team consisted of Tyler Long, myself, Joshua McCreight, and Bryce Karlins.
